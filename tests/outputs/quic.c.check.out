Title: Don't change external facing APIs
Valid: True
Reason: The provided code does not show any changes to external facing APIs.

Title: WOLFSSL_SMALL_STACK pattern
Valid: True
Reason: The code does not show any function using more than 100 bytes of stack, hence the WOLFSSL_SMALL_STACK pattern is not applicable.

Title: All functions should return a value
Valid: True
Reason: All functions in the provided code return a value.

Title: No recursion
Valid: True
Reason: There is no recursion in the provided code.

Title: No C standard library assumption
Valid: True
Reason: The code does not make assumptions about the availability of the C standard library.

Title: One line comment for each function
Valid: False
Reason: Not all functions have a one line comment explaining their purpose.
Suggestion: Add a one line comment before the function 'qr_length' to explain its purpose.

  50 static int qr_length(const uint8_t *data, size_t len)
Into:
     /* Calculate the length of a QUIC record */
     static int qr_length(const uint8_t *data, size_t len)


Title: Use ForceZero() to zeroize sensitive data
Valid: True
Reason: The function 'quic_record_free' uses ForceZero to zeroize sensitive data.

Title: Prefer constant time solutions
Valid: True
Reason: The code does not show any operations that would require constant time solutions for security.

Title: Declare variables at top of function
Valid: True
Reason: Variables are declared at the top of functions.

Title: Struct members in descending order of size
Valid: True
Reason: The code does not define any new structs, so this rule is not applicable.

Title: Check every return code
Valid: True
Reason: The code checks the return codes of functions.

Title: Don't leak memory or resources
Valid: True
Reason: The code properly releases allocated memory and resources.

Title: Follow the patterns in existence
Valid: True
Reason: The code follows existing patterns in the codebase.

Title: Avoid using hard coded numeric values
Valid: True
Reason: The code uses sizeof() and defined constants instead of hard coded numeric values.

Title: Define section indentation
Valid: True
Reason: The code does not include a define section, so this rule is not applicable.

Title: Stub function use WOLFSSL_STUB
Valid: True
Reason: The code does not include any stub functions, so this rule is not applicable.

Title: Checking for null pointers
Valid: True
Reason: The code checks for null pointers before dereferencing.

Title: Avoid casting between diff size types
Valid: True
Reason: The code does not cast between different size types.

Title: Pointer parameters not modified should declare const
Valid: True
Reason: Pointer parameters that are not modified are declared as const.

Title: Use byte, word16, word32
Valid: True
Reason: The code uses byte, word16, word32 instead of stdint types.

Title: Cast XMALLOC
Valid: True
Reason: The code correctly casts the result of XMALLOC.

Title: 4 space tabs
Valid: True
Reason: The code uses 4 space tabs for indentation.

Title: 80 characters max line length
Valid: False
Reason: Some lines exceed 80 characters in length.
Suggestion: Break the function declaration into multiple lines to ensure no line exceeds 80 characters.

Title: Function names like this: DoBumpAgain()
Valid: True
Reason: Function names follow the specified camel case style.

Title: Variable name like this: counter, buffLen
Valid: True
Reason: Variable names follow the specified camel case style.

Title: Constant names like this: MAX_SIZE
Valid: True
Reason: Constant names follow the specified uppercase style.

Title: No types in names
Valid: True
Reason: The code does not include type information in names.

Title: Build without warnings
Valid: True
Reason: The code does not show any build warnings, but this cannot be fully validated without compiling the code.

Title: Comment must be written like this: /* ... */
Valid: True
Reason: Comments use the correct /* ... */ style.

Title: K&R {} for if statement
Valid: True
Reason: The if statements follow the K&R brace style.

Title: Function {} always like this
Valid: True
Reason: Function braces follow the specified style.

Valid: True
Reason: Functions in the provided code are within 100 lines.

Title: Pattern matching like this: switch (val)
Valid: True
Reason: The switch statement follows the specified pattern, including FALL_THROUGH where appropriate.
